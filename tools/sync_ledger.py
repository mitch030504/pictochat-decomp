"""Reconstruct progress/matched.jsonl from committed data alone.

The ledger (progress/matched.jsonl) is local-only (gitignored - see
tools/ledger.py) so two contributors' bookkeeping never conflicts, but that
means a fresh clone (or a clone that just pulled someone else's merged PR)
starts with an EMPTY ledger even though src/ already has real matches in it.
Run this once after cloning or pulling to catch the local ledger up, so
tools/templates.py and friends don't waste time re-deriving candidates for
functions that are already matched.

Two ways a committed src/ file is matched back to (module, addr):
  1. Its `// decomp: module=... addr=0x... name=...` marker comment (see
     tools/ledger.py's marker_for()) - every file banked through ledger.bank()
     has one and this is the reliable path, robust to renames.
  2. Falling back to this project's filename convention (see
     notes/matching-style.md) for older files banked before the marker
     existed: src/arm{9,7}/<name>.c[pp], or <name>_<addr8hex>.c[pp] when a
     symbol name is disambiguated across modules. This ONLY works if the
     Ghidra cache's name for that address still matches the filename - it
     breaks once a function is renamed from its FUN_xxxxxxxx placeholder to a
     real symbol without the marker, which is exactly what the marker fixes.

Usage:
    python tools/sync_ledger.py            # report only
    python tools/sync_ledger.py --apply    # write progress/matched.jsonl
